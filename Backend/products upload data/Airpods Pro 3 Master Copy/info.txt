Apple AirPods 3rd Generation
The design of the AirPods 3 should feel familiar to anyone who has heard of AirPods before — and that should be a lot of people because sales of AirPods alone for Apple eclipses entire revenue streams from many other large corporations.

The AirPods 3 are a mashup of the case and stem design of the AirPods Pro but with the more airy, half-in-ear ear tip design from the AirPods 2. Think of them as the AirPods Pro without the silicone ear tips, which is the best way to describe their design. This means that the new earbuds don’t create a tight seal in your ears. Instead, they will lightly rest on and inside your ears. This design will be comfortable to a lot of people as it does not completely block out external sounds, while still providing a good enough sound experience. This also means you don’t have to worry about losing the ear tips, since there are none, to begin with.
